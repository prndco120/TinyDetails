            <h2>September 29, 2019</h2><p>This was Madelyn's first time meeting Patrick. On the drive back to Shreveport,
                    we exited from I-20 and we were "flying" over houses and trees until we we came back down and
                    landed level with the ground. Her imagination amazes me. We made
                    halloween cupcakes! She mixed the batter and sprinkled the cupcakes. I think what she loved most,
                    however, was eating the leftover sprinkles. We all watched Invader Zim while we enjoyed our treat.
                    Madelyn loved Patrick's 3D printer dinosaurs.
                    We played with toys for a bit and then took a long 1.5 hour trip back to Texas.

            <h3>About My Site</h3>
            <p>This is where I like to document the fun had in my life! Whether it is with Madelyn and Patrick, or other adventures and muses. This is the spot for my world; well, most of it. 
            I am a creative introvert who, while all over the place at times, has a passion for learning and creating. In October I began to learn about web develepment and am chipping a place for myself among the creative programmers that are called web developers. I thought a website would be a good way to keep track of my progress, apply concepts, and have fun at the same time.  As I become proficient at web development I plan to have links to my work in my portfolio. For now here is some placeholder text. Well that's about it for this page. Baby steps...

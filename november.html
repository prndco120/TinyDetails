            <h2>November 8, 2019</h2>
            <p>We helped Mommy and Patrick make tacos, we went to Sci-port, we made brownies, we played with
                    dinosaurs, we watched Tayo (the bus), we drew on Mommy's and Patrick's arms, Maddie cuddled all
                    night with Mommy, and we went to the park, where thanks to Patrick's help, Madelyn conqured some
                    fear of heights.</p>

            <h2>November 22, 2019</h2>
            <p>So here we had some more adventures at the park. I got her that sweater and absolutely love seeing her in
                it. We got a good shot of her crawling through one of the tubes. She was also a little dare devil
                swinging from the yellow pole. I love the big face shot of her just being her goofy self and soaking up
                the camera like a ham. My favorite shot is her stepping off the equipment trying to get her hair out of
                her face with a partial smile like some Instagram model. (Thank you, Patrick!) We also have another
                "Instagram" photo in black and white where she is captured in the deep contemplative thought, not which
                is that of the average four year old. Mostly on this bench, however we ate donuts, donuts holes, and
                drank milk while Madelyn had a short interest in the
                "cute" geese behind us.
